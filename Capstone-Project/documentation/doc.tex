\section*{Problem statement}
We want to predict the price of EURUSD ratio and NASDAQ stock. This is a timeseries forecasting problem. The goal is to create a script that will forecast future values basing on input provided as starting point. Then a web application will serve forecasts live by downloading information from third party services.

\section*{Evaluation metrics}
MSE between predicted $y$ and actual values $\hat{y}$:
\begin{equation}
	MSE = \frac{1}{2} \left( y - \hat{y} \right)^2
\end{equation}
Model loss will be calculated from validation set that will be less or equal 20\% of the actual values that a model tried to predict from a starting point. This means that up to 40\% tail of the dataset is reserved only for evaluation during training and will not be fed as input. For final model testing the actual values from validation set will be included as input to predict test actual values.
